            <h2>Who we Are</h2>
            <p>Founded by Stanley and a team of dedicated local responders, Hope Alive was born from a refusal to stay silent while families were being erased by extremist violence. We are a grassroots humanitarian organization committed to providing immediate life-saving intervention and long-term restorative care to those targeted by banditry and systemic attacks.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>At the Hope Alive Foundation, we believe that no act of violence should have the final say in a person’s story. Our mission is to stand in the gap for persecuted and displaced communities in Nigeria’s Middle Belt and Northern regions, transforming sites of devastation into centers of recovery and resilience.</p>

            <h2>Our 4 Pillars of Restoration</h2>
            <p>TWe don’t just deliver aid; we rebuild lives. Our work is centered on four essential needs:</p>
            <ul class="values-list">
                <li><strong>Crisis Intervention:</strong> Rapid deployment of food, clean water, and emergency shelter to families fleeing active conflict zones.</li>
                <li><strong>Holistic Healing:</strong> Providing both physical medical care for the wounded and specialized trauma counseling to mend the invisible scars of war.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Rebirth:</strong> Helping farmers return to their ancestral lands with seed distribution, tool kits, and the materials needed to rebuild charred homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Advocacy:</strong> Being a voice for the voiceless by documenting the crisis and ensuring the global community hears the truth about the persecution in Nigeria.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card about-card">
            <i class="fas fa-hands-helping brand-icon"></i>
            <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
            <p>Dignity Above All: We serve victims not as "refugees," but as neighbors. Every kit we deliver and every house we roof is an act of restoring a person’s inherent worth.
                Radical Transparency: We honor our donors by ensuring every cent is accounted for. We believe that those who give their hard-earned money deserve to see the faces and stories of the lives they have changed.
                Local Partnership: By working with verified local leaders and vigilante support networks, we ensure our aid reaches the most "unreachable" areas safely and effectively.
